= REDVECTOR

== Under Construction

Lots to do


== Migration for now

Currently we're storing dictionary/posting in a database table:

  class AddRedVector < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :tokens do |table|
        table.column :token, :string
        table.column :total_frequency, :integer
        table.column :number_of_postings, :integer
        table.column :idf, :float
      end
      create_table :postings do |table|
        table.column :token_id, :integer
        table.column :frequency, :integer
        table.column :indexed_id, :integer #id of the indexed record 
        table.column :indexed_type, :string #model type of indexed record
      end	
    end
  
    def self.down
      drop_table :tokens
      drop_table :postings
    end
  end

Plan is to come up with a better approach and get off of DBs / ActiveRecord

== History

Went through a couple of different rewrites - again starting from the bare essentials once 
again to expand the original purpose beyond a simple VSM - based search engine.. Lots more
to come.
